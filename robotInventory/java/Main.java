// Java is based around classes, which are descriptions of certain specific types of objects. They can be made up of state
// information (which is stored in variables called "members") and behaviors (as functions called "methods"). Each .java
// source code file must contain the definition of a class that matches the file's name. In this case, this file is called
// "Main.java" and we are declaring and defining a class called "Main" below.
public class Main
{ // This curly brace marks the start of the Main class's definition; everything inside these braces is part of Main.

//    Below is a method called "main()" (note the lower-case M and parentheses). Methods are sequences of code which can
//    be executed by "calling" them. The main() method is special because it's the method that the Java Virtual Machine
//    (the program that executes Java code) calls to start your program, called the "entry point." It is static, meaning
//    that it can be called without an instance of the Main class existing, and it takes an array of Strings called "argv"
//    as a parameter. If you were to run your code from a terminal, argv would contain any of the arguments that you
//    included in your command.
    public static void main(String[] argv)
    { // This is the start of the main() method. When main() is called, everything inside of these braces will run.
        // Your code here
        
    } // This is the end of the main() method.
    
} // This curly brace marks the end of the Main class's definition.
